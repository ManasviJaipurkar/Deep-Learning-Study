1.Dataset Preparation: 
The code begins by downloading the Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle, which is a popular dataset for binary image classification tasks. 
The dataset is then extracted from a ZIP file, making it accessible for further processing.

2.Model Selection: 
The VGG16 architecture is chosen for this task. VGG16 is a well-known deep learning model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 
millions of images across various categories. By using VGG16 as a base, the code leverages transfer learning, which allows the model to utilize 
features learned from a vast dataset to improve performance on a smaller, specific dataset (dogs vs. cats).

3.Model Configuration: 
The VGG16 model is configured without its fully connected top layers, focusing on the convolutional base for feature extraction. 
The model's layers are initially set to be non-trainable to preserve the learned features. However, the layers after block5_conv1 are made trainable to 
allow the model to adapt to the specifics of the new dataset during training.

4.Data Augmentation: 
To enhance the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting, the code uses data augmentation techniques. 
This involves randomly transforming training images through operations such as rescaling, shear, zoom, and horizontal flipping, creating a 
more diverse training set from the existing images.

5.Data Generators: 
Two separate data generators are created: one for the training set and one for the validation set. These generators load images 
from specific directories, apply the defined augmentations, and resize the images to match the input dimensions required by the VGG16 model.

6.Model Compilation: 
The CNN model is compiled with the RMSprop optimizer, which is effective for training deep networks. The loss function used is 
binary cross-entropy, appropriate for binary classification tasks. Accuracy is included as a metric to monitor the model's performance during training.

7.Model Training: 
The model is trained for ten epochs, during which it learns to classify images based on the patterns identified in the training data. 
Each epoch consists of feeding batches of training images into the model and updating the model's weights based on the calculated loss and gradients. 
The training process outputs accuracy and loss metrics for both the training and validation datasets, allowing for real-time performance assessment.

8.Model Evaluation: 
After training, the code visualizes the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs using plots. This helps in 
understanding how well the model learned and whether it overfitted on the training data.

9.Prediction Function: 
Finally, a function is defined to make predictions on new images. It preprocesses the input image (resizing, normalizing), 
passes it through the trained model, and then outputs the predicted class label (either 'Dog' or 'Cat'). The function also visualizes the input image 
along with the prediction, making it easy to interpret the results.
