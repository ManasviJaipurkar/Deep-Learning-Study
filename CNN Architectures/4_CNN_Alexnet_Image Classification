Data Loading and Preprocessing: 
The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data(), which provides training 
and test samples of 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes. The data is normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0, and the
labels are reshaped for compatibility with model training.

Data Visualization:
Several functions are implemented to visualize the images and their corresponding labels. Random
samples from the training dataset are displayed to provide insights into the data distribution. 
Additionally, bar plots are created to show the distribution of classes in both training and test datasets.

Model Architecture: 
An AlexNet model is constructed using Sequential() from Keras, featuring multiple convolutional layers (Conv2D), 
activation functions (ReLU), max-pooling layers (MaxPooling2D), and fully connected layers (Dense). The model is designed to 
take 227x227x3 input images and produce class probabilities through a softmax output layer.

Model Training:
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is then 
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for 100 epochs. Training history, including accuracy and loss, is plotted to evaluate the model's performance over time.

Evaluation and Visualization of Results: 
The model's predictions are generated on the test dataset, followed by the computation of a confusion matrix to 
assess classification performance. The confusion matrix is visualized, and example predictions are displayed alongside 
actual labels for comparison, showcasing the model's effectiveness in classifying images.
