1. Importing Libraries
PyTorch: Used for building and training the CNN model (torch, torchvision, torch.nn, torch.optim).
Matplotlib: Used for plotting images of predictions.
NumPy and Pandas: External libraries for numerical and data manipulations.
Torchvision: Provides datasets and transformations.

2. Loading the MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is downloaded using torchvision.datasets.MNIST. The images are transformed into tensors using ToTensor(), making them suitable for training.
The dataset is split into training and testing data:
Train Data: 60,000 samples of 28x28 pixel grayscale images.
Test Data: 10,000 samples of 28x28 pixel grayscale images.

3. Data Loader
DataLoader: Used to load the dataset in batches for both training and testing.
Batch Size: Set to 50, meaning 50 images are processed in each batch.

4. CNN Model Architecture
The model consists of 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers:
Convolutional Layers: Learn features from the images using 10, 20, 40, and 80 filters, respectively, with ReLU activation and max-pooling layers.
Dropout Layer: Used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons during training.
Fully Connected Layers: After flattening, the output is passed through two fully connected layers with 50 neurons in the first layer and 10 output neurons (for 10 digit classes).
Softmax Activation: Used in the output layer to convert the logits into probabilities for each digit class.

5. Training the Model
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
CrossEntropyLoss is used as the loss function.
During training, for each epoch, the model computes the loss, backpropagates, and updates the weights using the optimizer.

6. Testing the Model
The model is evaluated on the test data after each epoch. It calculates the average loss and accuracy on the test dataset.
Predictions are made by selecting the class with the highest output score from the model.

7. Prediction on Specific Samples
The code makes predictions on specific indices from the test dataset.
The prediction is displayed along with the corresponding MNIST image using Matplotlib.

8. Training Process
The model is trained for 50 epochs, with the training and testing functions executed in each epoch.
The train() function performs forward and backward passes, and the test() function evaluates the model on test data.

9. Prediction and Visualization
After training, the model is used to predict the labels of specific test samples (indices like 33, 78, 666).
The corresponding image and predicted label are displayed using Matplotlib.
